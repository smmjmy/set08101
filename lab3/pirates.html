<h1>1650s - 1730s</h1>
<img src="Jolly_Roger.png" />
<p>The Golden Age of Piracy is generally considered to have begin in the 1650s
	with the exploits of famous Buccaneers such as Henry Morgan who is perhaps most
	famous for the sacking of Panama in 1671.
</p>
<p>However, true piracy did not reach its
	peak until Benjamin Hornigold established the Pirate Republic in the fort at Nassau
	(New Providence Island) in 1714.
