			<p>You break out into a sprint, trying to reach the flickering 
			light before it can vanish from view, but it always seems to remain 
			out of reach. You run until your lungs heave with the effort, 
			your legs coated in mud from the bog. Just when you think you can't 
			possibly chase it any longer, it falters. You reach for it and--
			<br/>
			<br/>
			You tip over the edge and plunge into the water, the light winking 
			out before your eyes. You flounder in the thick, marshy waters, 
			but it's no use. The mud has made your clothes heavy, and your 
			muscles are too exhausted to keep you afloat for long.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			You sink.
