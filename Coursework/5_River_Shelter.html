			<p>Mercifully, the door swings inwards when you try the handle. 
			The hinges are so rusted that it sticks partway, 
			but you manage to squeeze yourself inside. It's too dark to see much, 
			but you make out a small cot pushed up against the wall. 
			The blanket on it is old and ratty, but when you force the door shut 
			the hut keeps out the worst of the chill. You're still hungry and thirsty 
			(though not yet desperate enough to drink the swamp water), 
			but at least you don't have to sleep out on the ground again. 
			It's getting difficult just to keep your eyes open.
