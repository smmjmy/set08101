			<p>You fall asleep almost as soon as your head touches the ground. 
			Your dreams are strangely muddied and filled with strange plant life 
			you don't recognise. You awake slowly, you can't tell how much time 
			has passed. An hour? A night? It's still dark when you open your eyes,
			and the ground beneath you is strangely damp. You try to stand, but 
			find yourself unable to move. There are vines trailing up from the 
			waterlogged soil, threading through your limbs and binding them tight.
			refuse to budge, no matter how hard you struggle.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			You were unwise to let your guard down here. 
			The forest will not forgive your mistake.
