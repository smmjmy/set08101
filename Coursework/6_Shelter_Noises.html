			<p>You awake in the night to a strange noise, and it takes you a minute to remember 
			where you are. The woods, the river, the cabin. The room is pitch black, but you're fairly 
			confident the sound came from outside. You pause, straining your ears to listen and-- 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			There! Something scrapes along the outside wall, so gently you could almost mistake it for 
			a brushing tree branch, but tree branches don't slowly circle around corners. 
			Whatever it is drags something sharp along the length of the stone wall, starting by your
			feet and making its way up towards your head. You hold your breath when it pauses at the
			corner before making its way along the next wall too. It circles the perimeter of the house 
			before coming to a halt at the door.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			By this point, your heart is racing. There's nothing in the shack to barricade the door with, 
			but at least you could hold it closed if the handle starts to turn. Then again, if it's some 
			kind of animal out there, wouldn't it be better to stay silent and hope it loses interest?
