			<p>It's too dark to even see the ground beneath your feet. You can only tell where the 
			remaining river is when you overstep and plunge your feet into the icy water. 
			It's so cold, you can barely even feel it anymore. You'd hoped the darkness might make it 
			easier to see the lights that might indicate a city or a campsite, but there is nothing.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			On your next misstep, you plummet knee-deep into the bog. You don't even have the strength to 
			pull yourself out again. The cold has sapped the strength from your muscles. 
			Even worse, you find it difficult to bring yourself to care. 
			Your mind is muddled from exhaustion and dehydration.
