			<p>You're forced to turn sideways to keep walking. You can't see in the darkness, 
			but you know your bare arms must be covered in scrapes. You press onwards, 
			even when the passage grows narrow enough for the jutting rocks to graze your chin. 
			Your breath hitches on every inhale, the walls pressing in against your chest as you 
			try to force air into your lungs. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			It would be almost unbearable without the cold breeze 
			on your face, but you know the exit must be close. You can feel it.
			The tunnel inclines sharply downwards, and the ceiling droops so low 
			that you're forced to crawl awkwardly on your stomach to keep going. 
			There's no room left to turn around, but there's a faint glow illuminating the path ahead. 
			There must be an opening up ahead somewhere.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			You couldn't turn back now if you wanted to. There is nowhere to go but forward.
