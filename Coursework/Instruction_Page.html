			<p>Through the Trees is a survivalist/horror choose your own adventure-style quiz.
				<br/>Your goal is simple:
				Find a way out of the forest without falling victim to the elements.
				<br/> Beware, there is more living in these trees than just the birds.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				In this game, you choose your own path! Every decision you make impacts alters the route you take and will ultimately
				decide whether you survive or perish in the trees. There are accompanying ambient tracks on several pages to add to the
				atmosphere, but these can be toggled on or off depending on your preferences.
				With danger lurking around every corner and 13 possible endings to
				find, there's only one thing left to say.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Good Luck.
