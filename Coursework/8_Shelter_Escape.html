			<p>You hold the door closed until the first rays of sunlight start to poke through the gaps 
			in the wooden ceiling, and just like that, the clawing stops.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			You wait a while longer just to be sure, straining to hear any indication of movement, 
			but it is silent. You can't even hear the birdsong anymore. 
			Slowly, you open the door a few inches and peek out.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Nothing.
			<br/>
			<br/>

			When you step out, you see the scratches aren't the aimless, animalistic markings that you'd 
			assumed. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Your name has been gouged into the wood with painstaking care. 
			There is a path leading away from the hut, you hope back to some sort of hiking trail 
			or other form of civilisation. You turn away from the swamp and don't look back.
