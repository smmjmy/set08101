			<p>Your visit to the circle leaves you oddly disoriented, though you can't quite figure out why. 
			Perhaps the exhaustion is finally getting to you? You walk for hours, long past the point when the sky 
			should have darkened. Did you fall asleep? You don't remember ever stopping. Come to think of it, 
			you don't remember when you stopped climbing either. You're back out in the woods now, and there's nothing 
			to see but endless rows of trees. For all you know, you're walking in circles. You should probably try 
			and find something to mark the way. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			You wait to run into something familiar, like the river. 
			Even just an identifiable landmark to set the place apart, but everything blurs together into a haze of 
			green. Eventually you stagger out of the trees and into a campsite. It takes you a full minute to 
			register what you're seeing. The hikers are kind enough to offer to guide you home, though you can't 
			quite remember where that is anymore. When you ask for the date, you realise over a month. 
			ou don't know how much of that time was spent in the trees and how much from before...
			<br/>
			<br/>
			No matter, the forest can keep your lost time. You have your freedom.
