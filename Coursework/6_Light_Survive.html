			<p>You spend most of the night staggering through the woods and oddly disoriented. 
			It's difficult to keep your thoughts in order beyond staying by the river. 
			You pause to rest a few times, almost succumbing to the urge to sleep, but you resist. 
			Something about the woods at night disturbs you, even if you weren't afraid the cold would get you first. 
			Walking keeps you warm, so you do your best to keep moving. At least with the river to guide you, 
			you know you're not walking in circles.			
			<br/>
			<br/>
			It takes all night, but when the dawn breaks you catch a glimpse of 
			a well-worn trail in the trees. A path back to civilisation, at long last.
