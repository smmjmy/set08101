			<p>You kick out with your other leg and hit something solid beneath 
			the water, but the grip around your ankle is solid as iron. 
			Nails dig in hard enough to break skin. It yanks you back, 
			across the stones, and your head once again plunges beneath the water 
			before you can take a breath. The sunlight filtering through the water 
			illuminates the pale face only inches from your own, dirty reeds trailing 
			from its scalp in a mockery of hair. You open your mouth to scream, 
			but the water has already filled your lungs. You are dragged deeper into 
			the murky depths until even the sunlight cannot reach you.
