			<p>Within seconds the path grows too dark to even make out the stones beneath your feet. 
			You stumble blindly through the tunnel, hands outstretched in front of you. 
			More and more often your fingers graze the damp stone walls. The tunnel is getting narrower. 
			When you look back, you can no longer see the mouth of the cave. 
			The walls close in with every step untl they brush your shoulders as you walk. 
			If it continues on like this for much longer, the path will soon be too narrow to walk.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Just as it starts to seem hopeless, a cool breeze brushes your face, bringing with it the 
			smell of trees. There must be an opening somewhere up ahead.
