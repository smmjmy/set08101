			<p> You gorge yourself on the berries and feel some of your strength return. 
			The juices dye your fingers a dark red that refuses to shift no matter 
			how many times you wipe them on the grass. You set off again but can't help
			but notice the path doesn't look quite right anymore. You can't put your 
			finger on what's changed until you turn a corner and see a shape looming 
			in the darkness. You can't make out much more than a silhouette, but 
			whatever it is, it's far bigger than you are.
