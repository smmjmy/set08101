			<p>You squeeze your eyes tight shut and freeze in place, 
			praying whatever it is will move on. You can hear breathing now as something 
			shifts its weight on the bed of dry leaves and loose twigs. 
			You hold your breath and hope...hope...hope...			
			<br/>
			<br/>
			When nothing happens, you open your eye a fraction and realise the patch of 
			shadow where you would have sworn you'd seen movement is now empty. 
			Did it move? Was it just your imagination? 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Your stomach is starting to hurt 
			now. You wonder if eating all those berries was such a good idea after all.
