			<p>You fall asleep almost as soon as your head touches the ground.
			Your dreams are strangely muddied and filled with strange plant 
			life you don't recognise.
			<br/>
			You awake slowly, you can't tell how much time has passed.
			<br/>
			An hour? A night? 
			<br/>
			It's still dark when you open your eyes, and the ground beneath 
			you is strangely damp. You try to stand, but find yourself unable 
			to move. There are vines trailing up from the waterlogged soil, 
			threading through your limbs and binding them tight.
			They refuse to budge, no matter how hard you struggle.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			You were unwise to let your guard down here. 
			The forest will not forgive your mistake.
