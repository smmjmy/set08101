			<p>You don't remember falling asleep, but you wake in fits and starts. 
			You see glimpses of the trees, the first rays of daylight peaking through 
			the leaves.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			You blink, and it's midday. Your lips are dry and cracked, 
			your stomach growling again, but you can't muster the strength to stand. 
			You blink, and the sky is growing dark again. You need to stand up. 
			You need to move, to find help, but your limbs refuse to cooperate. 
			You blink, and it's dark again. Has a whole day passed already?
			<br/>
			<br/>
			When your eyes close again of their own accord, they don't reopen.
