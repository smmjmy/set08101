			<p>You walk until your legs fail you and crumple to the forest floor. 
			Hopeless. It's all hopeless. You almost miss the sound from up ahead. 
			Something that sounds like...laughter?
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Raising your head takes what little strength you have left, 
			but your efforts are rewarded as you watch a pair of hikers stroll into view.
			Their faces fall in shock when they see you, and you can only imagine how 
			you must look, but you grin despite yourself. 
			You don't know what lies beyond the trees, but your rescue has arrived at last.
